# stm32f429

Peripheral Access API built with the latest
[svd2rust](https://github.com/japaric/svd2rust). In contrast to the
[stm32f429x](https://github.com/dkarwowski/stm32f429x/) crate, this
one contains no custom additions but aims to follow up with the latest
`STM32F429.svd` with the current `svd2rust` tool.
